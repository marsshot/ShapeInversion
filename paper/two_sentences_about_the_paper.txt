Non-uniqueness of geophysical inverse problems is particularly acute when multiple physical parameters are unknown (e.g. density, compresional and shear velocities). The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that inverting for geologic shapes, rather than cell-based parameter values, can mitigate this non-uniqueness by ensuring that the unknown parameters share a common set of interfaces across which they may change abruptly.
